Anybody who has spent time in Colorado and who enjoys the outdoors may have felt the allure to climb a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteener">14er</a>.
A 14er is one of the many mountains in Colorado whose summit is higher than 14,000 feet.

One of the challenges of hiking a 14er is the notion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_peak">“false summits”</a>. Your hiking along, your legs are burning, you’re feeling tired, and you see what you think is the summit.
Once you get there, you sadly realize that it’s only one of many summits on your way to the top. You gather your thoughts, have a snack, and push on.

Learning to become web developer is process filled with these “false summits”. You’re learning a lot at a very fast pace and feel good when you finally get your head around a concept,
only to realize that you have a long way to go. You’re constantly reminding yourself that it’s about the journey and not the destination.

Over the past week, we have been spinning up small aps in Sinatra using <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara">Capybara</a> testing.
Sinatra is a light framework that sits on top of Rack and is typically a precursor to Rails.
There a lot of moving parts to setting up a Sinatra app, but once it’s up and running, adding your routes, views and embedded Ruby is a lot of fun.

Being the responsible teachers that they are, we are pushed to make sure we have a very deep understanding of how it all works, namely, at this point,  the GET and POST requests.
In the blink of an eye, your browser makes a GET request to your application for a list of items. The application fires off to your database and returns the list.
The app then takes that list and assigns them to a local variable.
The local variable is then inserted into your HTML code and sent back to your browser so the page is rendered with the list.

Of course, like any good, challenging 14er, this is simply one of many, many summits to come.
