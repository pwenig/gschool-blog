I was feeling fairly confident coming into our second month at gSchool. We have moved seamlessly from Sinatra to Rails.
I have a good handle on models, views, and controllers and and can actually spin up a basic CRUD application in under an hour!
Keep in mind, this should take closer to 10 minutes.

But, then, the clock struck 2:00 and the wheels fell off! Class assessments (aka mid-term tests) are a lot like going from cooking in your home with your recipes, ingredients and an abundance of time to going on a TV show with a judge, a timer, a wildcard ingredient, and no notes!
If you’re new to the game, you’ll probably wind up making something mediocre if not horrible, like I did.

The positives of such an experience greatly outweigh the negatives.
Of course, you don’t realize this until the dust settles and you regain your confidence.
The pressure we feel with these assessments, I'm sure, is nothing compared to the pressures of our first technical job interviews.
We must learn to embrace these times, build on them, and keep moving forward.
