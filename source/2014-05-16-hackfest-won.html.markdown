In January, earlier this year, I attended a beer-themed Hackfest at <a href="https://twitter.com/quickleft">Quick Left</a>.
It was my first event like this. I watched in envy, as teams formed and quickly went to work
on building a beer-related app in under three hours.
The winners won some great beer swag in addition to some well-earned bragging rights.
I hadn’t started gSchool yet so I was purely a spectator and socializer.
However, as I watched the night unfold, I made a vow to return and participate in their
next Hackfest in May, which would have a game theme.

I not only returned..but won!

The skills we learn at gSchool all roll up into being able take business requirements and turn
them into working software. The working software is in the form of a minimum-viable-product
that will be continuously improved and revised.

When the May Hackfest started to come around, I formed a group with four other gSchoolers.
<a href="https://twitter.com/bluevajra">Cory</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/JennyAllar">Jenny</a>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/Nathanael_Burt">Nate</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/marthaberner">Martha</a>.
I joined the group intentionally knowing that we all understood the business requirements,
we had all worked well together on a group before and we were all serious about trying to win.

Being newer developers and really understanding the time constraint,
we decided on a text-based adventure game. Because the game would lack any graphics
we knew that the context of the adventure had to be relevant,
had to appeal to our audience of fellow hackers and tech geeks, and had to be hilarious.
Not just funny, but hilarious.

Our group workflow was probably the most impressive part of the whole experience.
We were all very clear on what part of the app we were responsible for.
The code flowed smoothly with a high degree of fun and a very low degree of stress.
We managed to avoid any serious merge conflicts and delivered, on time, a game that we knew people would love.

Just like any other proud parent, we are so thrilled that we brought Escape Boulder
into this world and can’t really imagine life without it. Click the below, start with the
help command and enjoy the adventure!
